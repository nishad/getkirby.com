### Dynamic options

Instead of defining options yourself, you can use an array of predefined dynamic ways to provide options:

#### Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: <?= $field ?> 
    default: architecture
    options: children
```

#### Available option keywords

Option                 | Description
-----------------      | -------------
children               | List of options with all children
visibleChildren        | List of options with all visible children
invisibleChildren      | List of options with all invisible children
grandchildren          | List of options with all grandchildren
visibleGrandchildren   | List of options with all visible grandchildren (added in 2.5.3)
invisibleGrandchildren | List of options with all invisible grandchildren (added in 2.5.3)
siblings               | List of options with all siblings
visibleSiblings        | List of options with all visible siblings
invisibleSiblings      | List of options with all invisible siblings
index                  | List of options with all descendants
pages                  | List of options with all pages of the site
files                  | List of options with all files of the page
images                 | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: images) of the page
documents              | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: documents) of the page
videos                 | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: videos) of the page
audio                  | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: audio files) of the page
code                   | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: code files) of the page
archives               | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: archives) of the page


### Option queries

An even more powerful way of generating dynamic options is the query option:

#### Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: <?= $field ?> 
    default: architecture
    options: query
    query:
      page: downloads
      fetch: files
      value: '{{filename}}'
      text: '{{filename}}'
      flip: true
```

#### Query Options

Option   | Default      | Description
-------- | ------------ | -----------
page     | current page | Any page URI. This is a powerful way to fetch any kind of data from any other page. You can even use relative paths to step up levels in the hierarchy. For example: ../../ to go two levels up or / to get to the top level.
fetch    | children     | See the list above for possible options
value    | {{uid}}      | A string to be used for the value attribute. You can use {{varname}} for any object method from the passed object (page or file)
text     | {{title}}    | A string to be used for the displayed option text. You can use {{varname}} for any object method from the passed object (page or file)
flip     | false        | If true, the list of options will be reversed
template | false        | A template name that will filter out all items with a different intended template

### Option from other field

Dynamic options can also be generated from the content of another field (source field):

#### Example

```
fields:
  favorite_drink:
    label: Favorite Drink
    type: <?= $field ?> 
    options: field
    field:
      page: menu
      name: available_drinks
      separator: ;
```

This works best for [tags fields](tags) as source fields.

#### Source Field Options

Option    | Default      | Description
--------- | ------------ | -----------
page      | current page | Any page URI. This is a powerful way to fetch any kind of data from any other page. You can even use relative paths to step up levels in the hierarchy. For example: ../../ to go two levels up or / to get to the top level.
name      | tags         | Name of the source field
separator | ,            | Separator by which the source field will be split up into the options

</since>

### Dynamic options via JSON API

Sometimes you need more control to fetch information from external sources. You can achieve this by providing a valid URL to an API, which returns a JSON object with keys and values for the <?= $page->title()->lower() ?> field

#### Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: <?= $field ?> 
    default: architecture
    options: http://example.com/api/categories.json
```

The json must have the following format:

```
{
  "design": "Design",
  "architecture": "Architecture",
  "photography": "Photography",
  "3d": "3D",
  "web": "Web"
}
```

<since v="2.5.0">
You can also use relative URLs and get the options from the same site:

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: <?= $field ?> 
    default: architecture
    options: url
    url: api/categories.json
```

Please note that the syntax is different as relative URLs are not detected automatically.
