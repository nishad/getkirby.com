**Is this plugin up to date?**

Time is precious and sometimes it would be just great to know if it is worth starting to read a blog article right now, or save it for later when you got more time to read it. That's where the new (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/plugins/readingtime text: Reading Time Plugin) by (link: http://roylodder.com text: Roy Lodder) comes in handy.

The Plugin makes it easy to display the estimated time to read any text in Kirby.

## Installation

The installation is as simple as ever. Download the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/plugins/readingtime/readingtime.php text: readingtime.php) and put it in `site/plugins` Create the plugins folder if it is not there yet.

## Usage

Once, the plugin is installed, you can instantly use it in your templates like this:

```php
<article>
  <h1><?php echo html($page->title()) ?></h1>
  <div class="readingtime">
    Estimated Reading Time:
    <?php echo readingtime($page->text()) ?>
  </div>
  <?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>
</article>

```

## Example Output

	Estimated Reading Time: 11 minutes, 31 seconds

## Localization

If you need to translate the output to a different language, you can directly do that by passing the following paramaters.

```php
<?php

echo readingtime($page->text(), array(
  'minute'  => 'Minute',
  'minutes' => 'Minuten',
  'second'  => 'Sekunde',
  'seconds' => 'Sekunden'
));

?>
```

You can even change the entire format of the result string:

```php
<?php

echo readingtime($page->text(), array(
  'minute'  => 'Minute',
  'minutes' => 'Minuten',
  'second'  => 'Sekunde',
  'seconds' => 'Sekunden',
  'format'  => '{minutesCount} {minutesLabel} â€“ {secondsCount} {secondsLabel}'
));

?>
```

This makes the plugin very flexible and you gain full control of the generated HTML.

I think it's a fantastic plugin and a great addition to any blog. Thanks to (link: http://roylodder.com text: Roy) for his help.
