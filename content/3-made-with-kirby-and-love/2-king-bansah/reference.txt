King Bansah is a king from Ghana who works as a car mechanic in Germany. To collect money for his people in Ghana he does a lot of charity work and even sings German "Schlager" in entertainment shows on television.

His latest project is to build a school in Ghana and this website is trying to collect enough donations to make that happen.
