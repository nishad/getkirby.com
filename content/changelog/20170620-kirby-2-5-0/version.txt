## Update!

A nasty little bug made its way into this release. (link: ../kirby-2-5-1 text: Please use 2.5.1) instead to get the fixed version.

## 2.5.0

With Kirby 2.5.0 we fixed a lot of bugs and also introduced some nice litte features:

## Highlights in 2.5.0

### Importing field groups into blueprints

In Kirby 2.2.0 we introduced (link: docs/panel/blueprints/global-field-definitions text: Global Field Definitions) that allow you to import field definitions into your blueprints.

With Kirby 2.5.0 we extended that feature. It is now possible to import whole field groups. This is especially useful if a large number of blueprints all need a specific set of fields. You can define them once and import them everywhere.

(link: docs/panel/blueprints/global-field-definitions#field-groups text: Read more about this feature in the docs).

### More flexible user handling

User objects are no longer required to have a password and an associated email address.
This is useful if you want to implement passwordless authentication (e.g. with OAuth, IndieAuth or SMS tokens).

There is also a new method called (sheet: user/login-passwordless) which you can use to log in a Kirby user after you have manually authenticated the user.

### Deleting pages with subpages in the Panel

If you are using the [Modules plugin](https://github.com/getkirby-plugins/modules-plugin) or if you are storing comments to your blog posts as subpages, you may have been in the situation that you wanted to delete a page with its subpages with one click in the Panel.

This was not possible until now. While this was a deliberate decision to make sure that whole page trees don't get deleted by accident, it was a pain for pages with modules, comments or other data in subpages.
Deleting page trees is now finally possible after confirming a warning message. Yay!

### Performance improvements with thumb handling

The Panel now only cleans up thumbs after page and file operations (e.g. uploading a file, renaming a page) if that's necessary. This improves performance a lot for image-heavy sites.
