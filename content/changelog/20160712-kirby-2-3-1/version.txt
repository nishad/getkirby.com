This release contains bug fixes and improvements for Kirby 2.3.0.
It is strongly recommended to upgrade to Kirby 2.3.1.

## Panel

- Global field definitions (field snippets) can now be registered by plugins:

```php
// The blueprint file must exist at the given location
$kirby->set('blueprint', 'fields/title', __DIR__ . '/blueprints/fields/title.yml');
```

- "Page settings" headline in the sidebar is now hidden if all options are disabled
- Respect `disabled` option for datetime fields
- Ignore invalid fields in `site/fields` again instead of throwing an error (introduced in 2.3.0)
- The Panel URL is now detected more reliably if the custom folder setup is used
- Fix "Call to a member function direction() on null" error
- Improve wording of the installer error for non-localhost environments

## Core

- Structure objects can now be shuffled
- `$page->is*()` methods now accept an URI string
- Fix a bug where multiple hooks with the same name would cause an error when triggered
- Fix `$field->pages()` method
- `$pages->find([])` with an empty array no longer causes an error
- Fallback for `$page->tinyurl()` if the tinyurl component is not loaded
- Reset template data after the template has been rendered
- Fix a bug where a controller could only be used once per page load
- Redirection to the homepage (`/home` to `/`) now works with custom homepages set using `c::set('home')`
- Fix a bug where the order of calling the `kirby()->urls()` methods would matter
 
## Toolkit

- More robust `$collection->shuffle()` method
- Fix database query resetting so that a query object can now be used for multiple queries again (introduced in 2.3.0)
- Improve extensibility of the `Sql` class with custom database drivers
- The `str::ascii()` representation of the character `รถ` can now be overwritten
