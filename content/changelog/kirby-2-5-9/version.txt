Kirby 2.5.9 is mainly a bug fix release. We also started to refactor important and complex Toolkit methods. And while we were at it, we added some smaller features. Enjoy!

---

## Panel

- Fixed the structure field's temporary data store in multilang sites [#1123](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues/1123)
- Fixed an error that would occur when using `pages: false` in the site blueprint [#1112](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues/1112)
- Command- or control-clicking on a link in the Panel is now respected and opens the destination in a new tab [#1130](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/pull/1130)

## Kirby

- Language detection does not fire anymore when deliberately switching languages on sites with no language at the domain root [#610](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/610)
- The redirect for the (sheet: options/ssl) option is now a permanent HTTP 301 one [#624](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/624)
- Fixed a regression that would break custom Smartypants components [#622](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/622)

## Toolkit

- Added the (toolkit: str/replace) method
- Refactored the (toolkit: collection/sort-by) method for compatibility with non-ASCII strings (e.g. accented characters) [#266](https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/issues/266)
- Refactored the (toolkit: a/merge) method: elements with numeric keys are now appended by default
- The (toolkit: url/idn) and (toolkit: url/un-idn) methods now use a userspace Punycode library instead of the built-in PHP functions to improve compatibility with hosting providers [#268](https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/issues/268)
- The session cookie is no longer set twice by accident [#267](https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/issues/267)
- Refactored the (toolkit: url/isabsolute) method so that other protocols and `mailto:` URLs are supported as well [#623](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/623)
- Redirects with (toolkit: helpers/go) now properly default to HTTP 302 instead of to HTTP 500 (which was previously corrected by the web server to HTTP 302) [#624](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/624)
- Redirects with (toolkit: header/redirect) now also default to HTTP 302 instead of HTTP 301 for consistency [#624](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/624)
- (toolkit: str/widont) now works with strings containing UTF-8 characters [#265](https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/pull/265)
- Updated the Spyc (YAML) and SimpleImage libraries [#1122](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues/1122)
