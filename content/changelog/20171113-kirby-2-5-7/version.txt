Kirby 2.5.7 is a bug fix release with a few additional smaller enhancements.

This is also a **security release**. It fixes two issues that have been reported to us recently:

- A **directory traversal** issue that would allow attackers to read any file of your Kirby installation via the (link: docs/developer-guide/plugins/assets text: plugin assets feature) or the (link: docs/developer-guide/panel/fields#adding-field-assets text: field assets feature).
	This issue **affects all Kirby sites**.
- A Cross-site Scripting (**XSS**) attack in the Panel that occurs when displaying specially prepared SVG images that have been uploaded as a content file.
	This issue **only affects you** if not all of your Panel users can be trusted or if you use a file upload form in the front-end that allows visitors to upload SVG files.

We take security very seriously, which is why we are also releasing the patch updates (link: changelog/kirby-2-3-3 text: 2.3.3) and (link: changelog/kirby-2-4-2 text: 2.4.2) for those who can't easily update their sites to 2.5.

It is **strongly recommended** to update to one of the fixed Kirby versions.

Thanks to (link: https://security.szurek.pl/ text: Kacper Szurek) and (link: https://about.me/security-prince text: Ishaq Mohammed) for letting us know about the issues.
