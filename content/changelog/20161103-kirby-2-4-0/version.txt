## Highlights in 2.4.0

### A new Starterkit!

We've secretly been working on (link: blog/a-new-starterkit-for-kirby text: **a massive update for the starterkit**). Fabian has come up with a great new design, lots of new content and documentation and many new built-in features. We are very happy about the result and hope you will like it too. It's included in every standard (link: https://download.getkirby.com text: download). The (link: https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit text: full source code) can also be found on Github.

### Permissions

The Panel finally supports permissions!

Each user role can now define a set of rules to restrict each Panel action based on the action type, the current page/file, user, language or even a combination of all of them.

You want to have a translator role that is only able to edit a specific language? Or an editor role that can only create new drafts in the blog but not publish them? Or a role that only allows users to edit their own profile page? It's all possible now!

(link: docs/panel/permissions text: Read more about this feature in the docs).

### Content Representations

One of Kirby's biggest advantages is its content structure. You can use as many fields and field types as you need to create content that isn't just a large WYSIWYG field.

Kirby 2.4 comes with a new core feature called "Content Representations" that allows you to output content in different formats. This could be (link: docs/cookbook/ajax-form-validation text: JSON for your AJAX script) or using Kirby as an API for other tools, an automatic RSS feed representation of your blog, or a plain text representation of your résumé.

(link: docs/developer-guide/advanced/representations text: Read more about this feature in the docs).

### Support for language-specific domains

Kirby now supports using a separate domain for each language out of the box:

```php
c::set('languages', [
  [
    'code'    => 'en',
    'name'    => 'English',
    'default' => true,
    'locale'  => 'en_US',
    'url'     => 'https://example.com',
  ],
  [
    'code'    => 'de',
    'name'    => 'Deutsch',
    'locale'  => 'de_DE',
    'url'     => 'https://example.de',
  ]
]);
```

Kirby will detect the language based on the domain, and links to other languages, e.g. in language switchers, will just work™.

### Kirby objects are easier to debug

Kirby objects such as `$page`, `$site` or `$file` have a lot of connections to other objects. The result is that a lot of stuff is printed when debugging those objects with `var_dump()`, `print_r()` or `dump()`.
Starting with Kirby 2.4, the most complex objects are now printed with their most important information only. Please note that this new feature only works with PHP 5.6 or later.

### Improved exception handling

Kirby now has a new powerful visual error view powered by [Whoops](https://filp.github.io/whoops/).
It becomes active automatically once you enable (link: docs/cheatsheet/options/debug text: debug mode). And on your production site it displays a nice and clean error page that doesn't tell attackers anything about the error.

### A big CLI Update

Our (link: https://github.com/getkirby/cli text: command line interface) got a big update as well. With many new commands, it is now even more powerful than before. Check out the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/cli text: CLI readme) for more information.
