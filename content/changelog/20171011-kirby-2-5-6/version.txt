This minor release fixes some bugs and adds a few enhancements.

It also fixes a **security issue** that would give users with an invalid role the permissions of the default role. Kirby now (link: docs/panel/roles#users-with-invalid-roles text: falls back to a role without permissions) to ensure that a user never has too many permissions. This issue only affects you if you are using custom roles and if one of your users has a role that doesn't exist or doesn't exist anymore.

Because of this fix, it is **strongly recommended** to upgrade to Kirby 2.5.6 if you are using custom roles.
