## Core

- The (sheet: helpers/css) and (sheet: helpers/js) helpers now accept an array of custom HTML attributes like the `defer` attribute [#506](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/506)
- Prevent overwriting of existing (custom) page models and methods using the registry [#536](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/536)

## Toolkit

- The (toolkit: helpers/csrf) helper now works correctly if `null` is passed as argument when checking the token [#240](https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/issues/240)
- Only generate one CSRF token per session, not per call of the (toolkit: helpers/csrf) helper [#242](https://github.com/getkirby/toolkit/issues/242)
