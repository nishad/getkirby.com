This release fixes a crash in the Panel when using structure fields without default value. If you use structure fields, please update to this release.

We are deeply sorry for this bug and the ones in the previous releases and will make sure that bugs like these don't happen again by releasing betas and release candidates even for minor releases in the future.

This release also fixes some other bugs and adds some minor enhancements.
