## Example

Since Kirby's default `.htaccess` prevents direct access to the `site/` directory, assets e.g. from a plugin need a route to be accessed. THis function offers an easy way to create such a route for a directory and its subdirectories:

```php
kirby()->modules()->assets('assets/myPlugin', __DIR__ . DS . 'assets');

// can then be used in a template
<?= js('assets/myPlugin/plugin.js') ?>
```
