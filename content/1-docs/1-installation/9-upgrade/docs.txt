## Advice

Don't update directly on your live server. You need to exchange a couple of things and your website would probably be broken during the upgrade. It's better to do the upgrade on a local installation.

## Updating the /kirby and /panel folders

Updating the /kirby and /panel folder still works like with 1.x versions. Just (link: http://download.getkirby.com text: download the latest Kirby starterkit) and replace the old folders.

## New index.php

Kirby 2 will not work with the old `index.php`.

## Changed site folder structure

The folder structure in your site folder has slightly changed. Please move your folders according to the following table.

Old                    | New
-                      | -
/site/panel/accounts   | /site/accounts
/site/panel/fields     | /site/fields

## Panel config

The panel config file is no longer loaded from `/site/panel/config.php`. Instead you should move all panel configuration options to `/site/config/config.php`

## Panel fields

Panel fields are completely different and more powerful in Kirby 2. Your old custom fields will not be working in Kirby 2. Read the guide (link: docs/panel/developers/custom-form-fields text: how to create panel fields in Kirby 2).

## Kirbytext extensions

Kirby 2 has a new concept for simpler Kirbytext extensions, which are easier to share between projects or other Kirby users. Unfortunately Kirby 1 Kirbytext extensions are not compatible with Kirby 2. Read (link: docs/advanced/kirbytext text: how to create Kirbytext extensions in Kirby 2).

## Accounts

Kirby 2 has a completely rewritten user management which supports secure password encryption. Old account files are thus no longer compatible with your new installation.

## Plugins

### Obsolete plugins

With Kirby 2 sending **emails**, building **tagclouds** and generating **thumbnails** have become **core features**. You no longer need to install plugins for those and you should even remove them to avoid conflicts.

### Update official plugins

Please update official plugins, which are listed on our (link: downloads text: download site), to make sure they will run in Kirby 2.

### 3rd-party plugins

Please check for updates of 3rd-party plugins and be aware that there might be issues with older plugins.

## .htaccess

We try to keep our .htaccess as compatible with many server environments as possible. Please (link: https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit/blob/master/.htaccess text: get the latest .htaccess) for Kirby 2, which will make installation of Kirby 2 less complicated in most situations â€” especially when installing Kirby 2 in a subfolder.

## Multi language version

The configuration for multi-language sites and the API for working with available languages has changed fundamentally. Please check out (link: docs/languages/setup text: the new way to setup multiple languages) and the (link: docs/languages/switching-languages text: examples for how to work with the language API). More can be found in the (link: docs/cheatsheet/#language text: cheat sheet).
