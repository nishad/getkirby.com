## Manual updates

Kirby has two updatable components: The **kirby** folder and the **panel** folder. 
The most straight forward way to update is to fetch the latest ZIP file from **<http://download.getkirby.com>** and just replace those two folders on your server.

## Updates with Git

### Updating submodules

If you are using Git submodules for the kirby core and the panel in your project, updating via the command line is very easy:

```
git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master
git submodule foreach --recursive git pull
```

### Updating each repository

If you've cloned the kirby folder and the panel separately and you don't track them with submodules, use the following lines to update:

```
cd kirby
git checkout master
git pull
git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master
git submodule foreach --recursive git pull

cd ../panel
git checkout master
git pull
```


## Cleaning the cache

If you've got caching enabled, you might need to clean the cache entirely to be sure nothing breaks. Just delete all contents from **/site/cache** in order to do so.
