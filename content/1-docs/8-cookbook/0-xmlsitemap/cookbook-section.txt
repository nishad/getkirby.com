For basic search engine optimization it's good to have a sitemap.xml file, which contains machine-readable information about all the pages and the structure of your site.

The syntax for such a sitmap.xml file is fairly simple. You can find all about it on <http://www.sitemaps.org/>

Because you probably don't want to generate that file by hand, I've created a little template for you, which automatically indexes your entire site and generates a sitemap.xml for you:

```php
<?php

$ignore = array('sitemap', 'error');

// send the right header
header('Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"');

// echo the doctype
echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>';

?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <?php foreach($pages->index() as $p): ?>
  <?php if(in_array($p->uri(), $ignore)) continue ?>
  <url>
    <loc><?php echo html($p->url()) ?></loc>
    <lastmod><?php echo $p->modified('c') ?></lastmod>
    <priority><?php echo ($p->isHomePage()) ? 1 : number_format(0.5/$p->depth(), 1) ?></priority>
  </url>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</urlset>

```

## Installation

Copy the entire code from above and put it in your `site/templates` directory in a new file called `xmlsitemap.php`

Go to your content folder and create a new invisible folder called `sitemap` and also add a text file to it called `xmlsitemap.txt` (and don't forget to add the language extensions if you are on a multi-language site).

You should now be able to visit the sitemap of your Kirby site by browsing `http://yourdomain.com/sitemap` or `http://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml` (Kirby ignores the extension, so you can use both)

### Exclude pages

To exclude certain subpages of your site, you can add their URI to the `$ignore` array. I've already done that for the sitemap page itself and also for the error page.

```php
$ignore = array('sitemap', 'error');
```

### Caching

If you are using the HTML cache, you should make sure to avoid caching of the sitemap file. Go to `site/config/config.php` and change the cache settings like this:

```php
c::set('cache.ignore', array('sitemap'));
```

This will make sure that your sitemap file is always served as proper XML.

## Automatic Priorities

The sitemap template will automatically try to create priorites for each page, by using the `->depth()` attribute. The depth attribute is a simple number, which indicates how deep the page is nested. Main pages have a depth of 1, subpages of main pages have a depth of 2, etc.

The home page will automatically get a priority of 1. You can easily change priorities or remove them entirely if you prefer.


## Submitting your sitemap to a search engine

To let your favorite search engines know about your brand new sitemap, please read the instructions on sitemap.org: <http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#informing>

## Improve it!

I'm always looking for contributers, to improve Kirby's extensions. I'm not a specialist with Search Engine Optimization, so if you have ideas how to improve the xmlsitemap.php template or any other extension, just let me know!!
