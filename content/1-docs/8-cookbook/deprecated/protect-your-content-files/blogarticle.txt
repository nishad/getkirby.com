Your content folder, where you store all the Kirby content files for your website, has to be accessible from the internet. Otherwise it wouldn't be possible to store images, pdfs or other downloadable or viewable files in there. 

This means that some clever bastards could guess the path to your content directories and read the text files, in which you store all your content. For example the content file for this article is visible here: <http://getkirby.com/content/05-blog/40-protect-your-content-files/blogarticle.txt>

In most cases you are probably going to store content in your Kirby content files, which is also visible on your website later, so it's no big deal. 

But if you plan to store some additional content in there – like personal notes about the current page, hidden data, which won't be visible to all visitor, etc. – you probably want to protect those files. 

Here are two ways to block visitors from reading your content text files:

## 1. Block access to text files

Add a new .htaccess file to your content folder:

Add the following lines to that .htaccess file

```txt
<Files ~ "\.txt$">
Order allow,deny
Deny from all
</Files>
```

Visitors, who try access one of your text files in the content folder will now get Apache's default "Forbidden" screen instead of seeing the content of those files

## 2. Rewrite URLs to text files

In my opionion it's even a better to obfuscate that there's such a file and to pretend that nothing has been found instead. You can simply do that by using Apache's rewrite module. 

Again, add a .htaccess file to your content folder and add the following lines: 

```txt
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule \.txt$ /error [R=301,L]

</IfModule>
```

All visitors, who try to access one of your text files in your content folder will now be redirected to the error page of your site. If your error page is not located at `http://yourdomain.com/error`, please adjust the RewriteRule line. 

By adding this rewrite rule your visitors will never guess that a text file even exists at that location. It looks like any other mistyped URL for your site. 

Unfortunately some cheaper shared hosting plans don't offer access to mod\_rewrite. So please check the docs of your hosting company or contact their support to find out if you can use mod_rewrite.
