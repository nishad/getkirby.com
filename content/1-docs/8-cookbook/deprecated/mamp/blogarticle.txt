Most Mac users will probably try Kirby with (link: http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html text: MAMP). It's a pretty awesome app to get PHP, Apache and MySQL running on your shiny Apple laptop without fiddling with the Terminal for ages. As far as I know there's a great  alternative for Windows users called (link: http://www.apachefriends.org/de/xampp.html text: XAMPP). I have never tried it myself, but the setup procedure should be similar. 

There's a great article by (twitter: @sashtown text: Sascha Lack) about (link: http://sashtown.de/kirby-auf-xampp-installieren/ text: how to install Kirby on XAMPP) (german)

## Installing MAMP

Installing MAMP is just a matter of downloading the app from the MAMP website and running the installer. It will install a MAMP app in your Applications folder.

By starting the MAMP app you are also starting your Apache and MySQL server. You should now be able to reach your local server at <http://localhost:8888>

## Download Kirby

It's time to get the Kirby source code at (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms text: Github).

## Copy ALL files

You will find the source of Kirby in your Download folder, **but there's pitfall!** By default the Finder does not show invisible files. The .htaccess file, which is needed to generate nice URLs is such an invisible file. So we need to make sure to copy that as well.

## Show invisible files

There's a nice free app, which you can use to show invisible files on your Mac called (link: http://sweetpproductions.com/ text: DesktopUtility) Once hidden files are visible in the Finder, your Download of Kirby should look like this:

Copy all files from the "bastianallgeier…" folder and add them to the `~/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/kirby` folder:

That's basically – almost – all you need to do to install Kirby. You should now be able to access it at: <http://localhost:8888/kirby> in your browser.

## Running Kirby in a subfolder

Normally your Kirby-flavored website would probably have its own Domain. Something like `http://mysite.com`, but in this case we are running Kirby in a subfolder of `http://localhost:8888` This means that we need to adjust the config a little bit. When you go to <http://localhost:8888/kirby> you should already see an instruction screen how to do that. 

It's pretty easy: Go to `site/config/config.php` and open that file in your favorite editor.

Change…

```php
c::set('url', false);
```

…to…

```php
c::set('url', 'http://localhost:8888/kirby');
```

…and…

```php
c::set('subfolder', false);
```

…to…

```php
c::set('subfolder', 'kirby');
```

Save the file.

## One last step

Also open the .htaccess file in your editor and change

	RewriteBase /

…to…

	RewriteBase /kirby


## That's it!

Open <http://localhost:8888/kirby> in your browser. You should now have a fully functional Kirby installation with working navigation and some tiny demo pages. Play around with the files and folders inside the content folder and the templates and snippets in the site folder to make your first steps with Kirby.
