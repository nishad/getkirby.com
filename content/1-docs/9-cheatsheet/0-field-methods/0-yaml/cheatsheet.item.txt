You can store structured data in fields with YAML. YAML is a simple structuring syntax, which is easy to understand and use.

For this example we are going to store multiple addresses in a single field:

    Title: Addresses
    ----
    Addresses:

    -
      Street: Rue de WTF 17
      ZIP:    1112
      City:   Monaco
      Phone:  555-1234
      Email:  me@monaco.org
    -
      Street: 1212 Broadway
      ZIP:    4321
      City:   New York
      Phone:  666-4321
      Email:  me@ny.org
    -
      Street: At the beach
      ZIP:    9999
      City:   The capitol of the Bahamas
      Phone:  777-9999
      Email:  me@bahamas.org

Those addresses can be fetched and parsed very easily in your templates with the `yaml()` helper.

```php
<?php foreach($page->addresses()->yaml() as $address): ?>
  <div class="address">
    <?php echo $address['street'] ?><br />
    <?php echo $address['zip'] ?> <?php echo $address['city'] ?>
  </div>
  <div class="contact">
    <?php echo $address['phone'] ?><br />
    <?php echo $address['email'] ?>
  </div>
</div>
<?php endforeach ?>

```
