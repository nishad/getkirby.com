A field value is considered as translated if it is not empty and is not equal to the field value of the default language. `$field->isTranslated()` will always return `true` for the default language as well as for single language setups.

## Example

```php
<?php if($page->description()->isTranslated()): ?>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <?php echo $page->description()->kirbytext() ?>
<?php endif ?>
```

## Check for a specific language
By passing a language code as the `$lang` parameter, you can check for a translation in that language:
```php
<?php if($page->description()->isTranslated('de')): ?>
  // Field 'description' is translated in German
<?php endif ?>
```
