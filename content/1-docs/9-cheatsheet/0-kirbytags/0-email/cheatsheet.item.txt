Kirby will automatically encrypt your email addresses, so they won't be that easy to be parsed and misused by spam bots.

## Examples and options:

Email without link text
```
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com)
```

Email with link text
```
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email)
```

Email with a title
```
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email title: Contact me)
```

Email with a custom CSS class
```
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email class: email)
```

Email with a rel attribute
```
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email rel: me)
```
