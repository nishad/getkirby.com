Title: User

----

Excerpt:

A user input field with autocompletion for registered users.

----

Text:

The user field is a standard text field, which comes with built-in autocompletion for registered usernames and a custom user icon. It's perfect to store an author for an article for example.

## Example

```
fields:
  author:
    label: Author
    type: user
```

<since v="2.5.7">
### Default values

The default value of the user field is the current user. But you can change this default value to any existing user:

```
fields:
  author:
    label: Author
    type: user
    default: johndoe
```

You can also disable the default value completely. The default then is "no user":

```
fields:
  author:
    label: Author
    type: user
    default: false
```
