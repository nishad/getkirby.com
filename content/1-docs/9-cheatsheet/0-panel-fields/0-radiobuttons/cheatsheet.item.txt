Title: Radiobuttons

Excerpt: A list of radio buttons

----

Text:

The radiobuttons field displays any number of radio buttons in a list. This is perfect if you have a predefined number of options, from which the user can just choose one.

## Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: radio
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web
```

### Example with a single default value

By default, the first item in the list of options is preselected. To change the default value:

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: radio
    default: architecture
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web
```
To prevent preselection of a value, set `default: false`.
