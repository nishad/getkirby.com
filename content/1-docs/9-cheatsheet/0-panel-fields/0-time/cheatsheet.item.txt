Title: Time

----

Excerpt:

A time picker field

----

Text:

The time field is perfect for events or any other kind of time-based field content. It creates a selectbox with all available times of the date defined by certain interval.

## Example

```
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
```

### Format

You can choose between the 12 hour (AM/PM) and the 24 hour format. The default is the 24 hour format.

```
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    format: 12
```

### Intervals

Intervals between selectable options are defined in minutes. The default is 60 minutes.

```
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    interval: 30
```

### Default

The default value can either be set to a specific time (e.g. `17:00`) – and will be matched with the closest interval option – or as `now`.

```
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    default: now
```

### Override

Setting the override option will always select the default instead of the already saved value, so that on saving the page again, it will be overridden with the default value.

```
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    default: now
    override: true
```
