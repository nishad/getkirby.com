Excerpt:

A simple selectbox field

Text:

The select field displays any number of options in a dropdown selectbox. This is perfect if you have lots of options, from which the user can just choose one.

## Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web
```
