Title: tinyurl.url

Since: 2.4.0

Excerpt: Separate domain for tinyurl links: {url}/{hash}

----

Text: 

This setting overrides (sheet: options/tinyurl-folder) for tinyurl links. The other option is responsible for incoming requests to the tinyurl folder.
`tinyurl.url` can be used to define a separate domain for tinyurls.

## Example

```php
c::set('tinyurl.url', 'https://sho.rt');
```

Kirby will now generate tinyurl links based on the given domain.

**Please note**: You need to make sure that all URLs from `https://sho.rt/*` redirect to `yourdomain/x/*`. You can use a `RewriteRule` like this in the `.htaccess` of the `sho.rt` domain:

```
RewriteRule (.*) http://example.com/x/$1 [R=301]
```
