if(!$user) throw new Exception('No user is logged in.');

$result = $user->permission('myplugin.permission', ['arg1', 'arg2']);
if($result->status()) {

} else if($message = $result->message()) {
  // user has no permission and $message contains why
} else {
  // user has no permission but the role doesn't want to tell why
}
```
