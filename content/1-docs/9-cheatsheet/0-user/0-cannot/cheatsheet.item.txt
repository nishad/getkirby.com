Text:

There is also (sheet: user/permission) that also returns an error message if the user has no permission.
If you want to check if the user *has* permission, use (sheet: user/can), which otherwise does the same.

## Example

```php
$user = site()->user();
if(!$user) throw new Exception('No user is logged in.');

if($user->cannot('myplugin.permission', ['arg1', 'arg2'])) {
  // user has no permission
} else {
  // user has permission
}
```
