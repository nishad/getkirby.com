## Default pages methods

**For a full (link: docs/cheatsheet/#pages text: list of default pages methods), please check out the cheat sheet.** Be aware that you cannot override these default pages methods with any custom pages method.

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined page methods very easily. The best place to do this is in a plugin file: `/site/plugins/pages-methods.php`

```php
pages::$methods['listAll'] = function($pages) {
  foreach($pages as $page) {
    echo '- ' . $page->title() . '<br>';
  }
};
```

This example shows the basic architecture of a pages method. You define the method name with the key for the `pages::$methods` array. The callback function receives the `$pages` object as first argument.


## Working with method arguments

In some cases it might be helpful to be able to pass arguments to the method:

```php
<?php echo $pages->withGame('Mario Kart 64') ?>
```

The definition for such a method with arguments is very simple:

```php
pages::$methods['withGame'] = function($pages, $game) {
    return $pages->filterBy('game', $game);
};
```
