## Default files methods

**For a full (link: docs/cheatsheet/#files text: list of default files methods), please check out the cheat sheet.** Be aware that you cannot override these default files methods with any custom files method.

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined files methods very easily. The best place to do this is in a plugin file: `/site/plugins/files-methods.php`

```php
files::$methods['listAll'] = function($files) {
  foreach($files as $file) {
    echo '- ' . $file->filename() . '<br>';
  }
};
```

This example shows the basic architecture of a files method. You define the method name with the key for the `files::$methods` array. The callback function receives the `$files` object as first argument.

## Working with method arguments

In some cases it might be helpful to be able to pass arguments to the method:

```php
<?php if($files->moreThan($num)) : ?>
  Page has more then $num files.
<?php endif ?>
```

The definition for such a method with arguments is very simple:

```php
files::$methods['moreThan'] = function($files, $num) {
    return $files->count() > $num;
};
```
