Title: Custom email drivers

----

Text: 

By default Kirby can send email via your server, Amazon SES, Postmark or Mailgun. If you want to send from another service, you can write your own email driver. 

An email driver is a callback function added to the `$services` array of the email class: 

```php
email::$services['yourservice'] = function($email) {
  // your adaptor code goes here.
};
```

To handle errors in your driver, throw a new Error Exception like this:

```php
email::$services['yourservice'] = function($email) {
  
  …
  // something went wrong
  throw new Error('Uh oh, that was not intended');
  …

};
```
