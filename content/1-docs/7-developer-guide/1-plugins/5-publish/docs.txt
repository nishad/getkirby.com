Title: How to publish your plugin

----

Text:

There are two places, where you can publish your plugin. 

## Add a readme

Make sure to add a useful readme with instructions to your plugin.

## Add a `package.json`

By adding a `package.json` file at the root of your repository, you allow others to install and update your plugin using the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/cli text: Kirby CLI).

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin-name",
  "description": "Short description of your plugin",
  "author": "Firstname Lastname <you@provider.com>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "kirby-plugin",
  "license": "your-license (e.g. MIT)"
}
```

## Put it on Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab

We highly recommend, that you put it in a public git repository, so other developers can clone, update it or even contribute to it.

## License

We don't require any specific license for plugins. Go for whatever works best for you.
