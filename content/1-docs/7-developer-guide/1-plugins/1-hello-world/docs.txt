A Kirby plugin can start as a simple file with a PHP function. All plugins are being installed in `/site/plugins`. The only requirement for a plugin is that the foldername has to be the same as the main php filename. 

```
/site/plugins/{plugin-name}/{plugin-name}.php
```

For example: 

```
/site/plugins/hello/hello.php
```

A good starting point is to create a simple helper function in your plugin, which you can then start to use immediately in all your templates, snippets and controllers. 

```php
// /site/plugins/hello/hello.php
function hello() {
  echo 'hello';
}
```

The new hello() function can now be used in a template:

```php
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php hello() ?>
<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

Of course this is a pretty useless example, but as you can see you don't have to follow lots of instructions and rules to get started with your own helper plugin.
