Title: How to create custom Kirbytags

----

Text:

Kirbytext — Kirby's extension of Markdown — comes with a set of helpful tags, which editors can use to add links, include images, embed videos and much more.

To make it even easier for your editors to create content and format text Kirbytext can be further extended with your own custom tags and rules.

## Creating your own Kirbytag

Custom Kirbytags are installed in `/site/tags`. Each tag gets its own PHP file.
The most simple form of a Kirbytag looks like this

##### /site/tags/wikipedia.php
```php
<?php

kirbytext::$tags['wikipedia'] = array(
  'html' => function($tag) {
    return '<a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>';
  }
);
```

You can invoke this by using the following tag in Kirbytext

```
(\wikipedia: somevalue)
```

The tag is pretty stupid though. It will only generate a link to Wikipedia with a link text called Wikipedia. It completely ignores the value of the tag so far.

To make use of the entered value the $tag object has an `$tag->attr($attr)` method, which can be used to fetch the value of any attribute of the tag.

```php
<?php

kirbytext::$tags['wikipedia'] = array(
  'html' => function($tag) {
    return '<a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/' . $tag->attr('wikipedia') . '">Wikipedia</a>';
  }
);
```

Now the tag will fetch the `wikipedia` attribute and pass the value to the link. The tag is now able to link to any article on Wikipedia:

```
(\wikipedia: Content_Management_System)
```

It's very easy to add more attributes to make the tag even smarter. An additional `attr` array defines which attributes are allowed within the tag. You don't have to define the main attribute though.

```php
<?php

kirbytext::$tags['wikipedia'] = array(
  'attr' => array(
    'text'
  ),
  'html' => function($tag) {

    $url     = 'http://wikipedia.org/wiki';
    $article = $tag->attr('wikipedia');
    $text    = $tag->attr('text', 'Wikipedia');

    return '<a href="' . $url . '/' . $article . '">' . $text . '</a>';

  }
);
```

You can now pass a text attribute to the tag and it will be used to build the link text.

```
(\wikipedia: cat text: Read all about cats…)
```

Another great feature of the `$tag->attr()` method is the fallback value, which makes it possible to react on missing or empty attributes and still provide some useful alternative.

```php
$text = $tag->attr('text', 'Wikipedia');
// if no text is given, the link text will be 'Wikipedia'
```

Just like in this example, tags can be very simple and generate something like a link. But of course you can extend this to generate entire galleries, tables, download lists or whatever you need.

### Accessing the current page

For some tags it might be necessary to access the current page or files of the current page. The `$tag` object has three methods to help you with this:

```php
$tag->page()
$tag->files()
$tag->file('myfile.jpg')
```

We can make use of this to create a simple download list tag.


##### /site/tags/downloads.php
```php
<?php

kirbytext::$tags['downloads'] = array(
  'html' => function($tag) {

    $html  = '<h2>' . $tag->attr('downloads') . '</h2>';
    $html .= '<ul>';

    foreach($tag->page()->documents() as $doc) {
      $html .= '<li>';
      $html .= '<a href="' . $doc->url() . '">' . $doc->filename() . '</a>';
      $html .= '</li>';
    }

    $html .= '</ul>';

    return $html;

  }
);
```

…which can be embedded in the text like this:

```
(downloads: Download documents)
```

This could be easily extended with more attributes/options to limit the number of files or download a different type of files, etc.
